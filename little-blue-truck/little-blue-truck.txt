little blue truck
horn went beep
engine purred
friendliest sounds you ever heard
little blue truck
came down the road
beep said blue
to a big green toad
toad said croak
and winked an eye
when little blue truck went rolling by
sheep said baaa
cow said moo
oink said a piggy
beep said blue
cluck said a chicken
and her check said peep
maaa said a goat
blue said beep
neigh said a horse
quack said a duck
beep said the friendly 
little blue truck
honk yelled a dump truck
coming through
i've big important things to do
i haven't got time to pass the day with every duck along the way
rooom went the dump around a curve
he saw a puddle and he tried to swerve
into the mud rolled the big fat truck 
and his big important wheels got stuck
his heavy duty dump truck tires
were sunk down deep in muck and mire
honk cried the dump and he sounded scared
but nobody heard and nobody cared
then into the mud bump bump bump
came the little blue truck to help the dump
little blue pushed with all his might
now blue and the dump were both stuck tight
help help help cried the little blue truck
beep beep beep i'm stuck i'm stuck
everybody heard that beep beep beep 
the cow came running with the pig and the sheep
up at a gallop ran the big brown horse
goat jumped over the fence of course
the hen came flapping with the check and the duck
and everybody pushed the little blue truck
head to head and rump to rump
they all pushed blue who pushed the dump
they couldn't quite budge that heavy load
then who hopped up but the big green toad
all together one two three
one last push and the trucks were free
thanks little brother said dump to blue
you helped me and they helped you
now i can see a lot depends on a helping hand from a few good friends
beep said blue who wants a ride
everybody scrambled to jump inside
oink quick baaa
moo cluck peep
neigh croak maaa
beep beep beep
